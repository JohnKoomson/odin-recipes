    <h2>Ghana Banku</h2>
    <p>Banku is one of the national dishes of Ghana originating from the Ga-Adangme people along the South Eastern coast of Ghana</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
          <li>Cassava</li>
          <li>Corn</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Water</li>
       </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
          <li>Traditionally, corn kernels or the kernels mixed with peeled and chopped cassava are soaked for a day, then milled into a smooth, fine and wet dough at commercial millers. Milling can be achieved at home in a powerful blender. One trick is to freeze the defrost chopped cassava to make it softer before blending. This dough is then allowed to ferment for 2 to 3 days, depending on how warm the climate is. In cooler temperatures it could take up to 4 or 5 days.</li>
          <li>You can also make this at home by mixing corn meal with just enough water to form a dough in a non-reactive bowl. Cover the dough with an airtight lid or cling film and allow to ferment for several days. You usually know it is ready when you see a few patches of mold form on the surface. Simply scrape off the top layer and discard.</li>
          <li>To make cassava dough, peel whole cassava using a knife, then proceed to grate the cassava with the smaller side of the grater. This takes time but the results do not disappoint. Mix with a little water and allow the pulp to drain for several hours. This can then be mixed with the corn dough and allowed to ferment together, otherwise it can be processed separately and drained of moisture for 2 to 3 days.</li>
          <li>The dough is cooked with salted water in a sturdy pot, with continuous stirring, using a solid wooden spoon. The dough clumps up and transforms into a gloopy pulp fairly quickly. It is then allowed to steam surrounded by a little water for several minutes in order to cook through thoroughly. Thereafter it is given a final mix. The consistency of traditional banku is very smooth, much like fufu, but it is not always possible to get that fine level of smoothness if using different varieties of corn meal.</li>
